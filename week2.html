    <h3>&#x1F39C; Identify a piece of music related to your theme to download and edit.<br>&#x1F39C; If you are using your own machine, you can use the Audiveris OMR tool to get started, or you can transcribe it from scratch.<br>&#x1F39C; Edit at least 10 bars in MuseScore, focusing on rhythm and pitch as a minimum. </h3>
    
  
<p><img src="css/season-score-edited-image.png" alt="Musescore Edited Seasons Score" style="float:left;width:700px;height:1000px;"> I transcribed seasons by wave to earth from scratch, then made some edits. I changed the tempo from 72 beats per minute to 80 beats per minute. I also added in dynamics, 'mf' - mezzo forte meaning moderatly loud. Furthermore, I changed the pitch of some notes throughout the peice.    <h3>&#x1F39C; What aspects of MuseScore were intuitive and worked well? <br> &#x1F39C; What aspects were challenging? </h3> </p>
