</h1>

    <h2>Task 1: Similarity</h2>

This involves:<br>&#127901; Extracting the Chroma features in SonicVisualizer<br>&#127901; Exporting the features as a CSV<br>&#127901; Save the code and notebook and save the visualization of the similarity matrix as an image for your portfolio</h3>

<h3>&#127901; Open your piece of music from Week 2 in MuseScore.<br>&#127901; Export it as a WAV file and as an image file<br>&#127901; Open the WAV file in SonicVisualizer <br>&#127901; Transcribe the file using the same process as the Group activity on Tuesday <br>&#127901; Open the MIDI file in MuseScore<br>&#127901; Export it as an image<br>&#127901; In your portfolio, display both images and compare the transcription, reflecting on its accuracy and identifying any information that has been lost (max 200 words)</h3>
